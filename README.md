# World of Nuclear - SPA for Browsers

We are doing our part to influence world-wide adoption of nuclear energy. This platform is being built with that purpose in mind.

## Lay of the Land

This is the primary interface for members (and future members) of the World of Nuclear. This provides access to key features, such as:

- Flux -- an area for open discourse and sharing ideas
- Lessons -- topics directly about or related to nuclear energy, presented for beginners
- News and Views -- a blog about what's happening in the world of nuclear energy

We are also working on a story-based adventure experience, with twists and turns, choices to make, and simulations to run...coming soon.
