# Intense Heat

Nuclear reactors operate at a wide range of temperatures depending on their type and purpose. These temperatures are determined by the reactor's design, coolant, and intended applications, such as electricity generation or industrial process heat.

### **Typical Operating Temperatures by Reactor Type**

1. **Light Water Reactors (LWRs):** The most common type of reactor, including Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs) and Boiling Water Reactors (BWRs), operates at temperatures up to about 300–345°C. These reactors use water as both a coolant and a moderator, requiring high pressures to keep the water in a liquid state at these elevated temperatures[1][2].

2. **Heavy Water Reactors (HWRs):** These reactors, like Canada's CANDU reactors, operate at similar temperatures to LWRs, around 300–350°C, but use heavy water as a moderator, which allows them to use natural uranium as fuel[2].

3. **High-Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactors (HTGRs):** These advanced reactors can reach much higher temperatures, typically between 750–950°C. They use helium as a coolant and graphite as a moderator, enabling applications such as hydrogen production or industrial process heat[1][5][8].

4. **Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs):** MSRs operate at approximately 860°C. They use molten salt as both a coolant and fuel carrier, allowing for efficient heat transfer and high-temperature operation[1].

5. **Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactors (LMFBRs):** These reactors achieve temperatures of around 500–540°C using liquid metals like sodium or lead as coolants. Their design supports high neutron fluxes for breeding fuel while maintaining efficient cooling[2].

6. **Very-High-Temperature Reactors (VHTRs):** A proposed Generation IV design, VHTRs aim for even higher temperatures of up to 950°C for advanced industrial applications like thermochemical hydrogen production[5].

### **Specialized Applications**

Some nuclear systems are designed for extreme conditions:

- **Nuclear Thermal Rockets:** These systems operate at extremely high core temperatures ranging from 2272 K (1999°C) to over 3300 K (3027°C) to maximize thrust efficiency in space propulsion[3].
- **Fusion Reactors:** While not fission-based, fusion systems like tokamaks reach plasma temperatures of about 150 million degrees Celsius to sustain fusion reactions[7].

The diversity in operating temperatures reflects the adaptability of nuclear technology to meet various energy demands, from electricity generation to high-temperature industrial processes.
