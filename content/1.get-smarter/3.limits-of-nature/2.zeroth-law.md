# Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics

Let's start with a simple definition. The zeroth law says that every substance has a temperature. More to the point, when you put things that are at the same temperature next to each other, their temperature does not change.

Right.

Strictly speaking, the law talks about **_thermal equilibrium_**. If two systems are in equilibrium with a third system, those two systems are also in equilibrium with each other.

In other words, they all have the same temperature.

For example, say you have two rooms that are separated by a wall with a closed door. Each room is air conditioned to 20˚C (68˚F). When you open the door, both rooms will stay at 20˚C. Any questions?

How about another example? Say you mix two or more liquids that are sitting on a shelf at room temperature. The resulting cocktail (non-alcoholic if you prefer) will also be room temperature. If you add ice, the temperature will change. Is this getting more fun?

One last example. Say you place a cast iron skillet in an oven and heat the oven to 350˚F. The temperature of the skillet will rise with the temperature of the oven rack and the surrounding air. Perfect for baking cornbread.
