# Limits of Nature

Do you want to understand how a nuclear power plant works, or a nuclear-powered submarine? You will want to learn about the science of heat. It also helps to understand how water is used to convert heat into work, productive energy that drives an engine or generates electricity.

Why not take this course now? Once you see the gears of reality, you will reach a new level of awareness.

## What's it all about?

Humanity has been tinkering with the steam engine for hundreds of years. In 1698, Thomas Savery, an English engineer, patented the first commercial steam-powered device for removing water from flooded mines.

Since then, through experimentation, pain-staking trial and error, and a bit of deep thinking, we have figured out the physics of heat energy, along with many effective ways of turning heat energy into useful work.

This introductory course explains the laws of thermodynamics, describes how water turns heat into work, and dives into the properties of water under pressure. These topics are directly related to using nuclear energy for power generation.
