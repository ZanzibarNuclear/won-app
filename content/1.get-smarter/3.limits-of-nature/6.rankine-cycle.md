# Rankine Cycle

A thermal power plant converts heat energy into power through a process called the Rankine cycle, pronounced ran-kin. The star player in the Rankine cycle is any liquid that can hold a lot of heat. That quality is called specific heat, and the specific heat of water is quite high. Also, water is abundant, safe, and easy to use.

Other materials can follow the Rankine cycle. In fact, we will introduce some of those when we talk about the latest nuclear power plant designs. For now, let's stick with the champion, our dear friend, water.

## Getting the Picture

Before we get too technical, let's get a good mental image of how the Rankine cycle works.

Imagine four pieces of heavy equipment connected by pipes to form a giant loop. The pipes carry water in liquid and vapor form. We are talking about a lot of water that is going to flow around very quickly, almost like a river but contained within the pipes and equipment.

Sometimes this is called a primary loop. That's where most of the action is. Secondary loops might be involved for other purposes.

Let's follow the water around the loop. At the first point in the loop, a powerful pump uses pressure to push the water. The second point is where the water passes a hot boiler that adds massive amounts of heat, turning the water to steam. A steam turbine sits at the third point, spinning like mad as the steam pushes its blades. At the fourth point, steam is turned back into water as it flows through a condenser. Finally, the water returns to the pump.

What you just imagined is the Rankine cycle. Take a long look at the picture below, and notice the points along the loop.

- Pump
- Boiler
- Turbine
- Condenser

By itself, that picture is not getting much done, other than turning water into steam and back into water. We need a few more details to grasp the ins and outs.

Starting at the first position, the pump uses electricity to run. We call that "work in" because work is being added to the system, and that does not happen for free.

The boiler at the next position is either burning fuel, like coal or gas, or splitting atoms in an intense fission reaction. We call that "heat in," enough heat that the liquid water leaves stage 2 as steam. The boiler might be inside a dedicated containment structure to provide safety from this fiery monster.

At the third position, the steam turbine is attached to an electric generator that sits somewhere outside of the loop so that it doesn't get wet. As the central shaft of the turbine spins at high speed, it spins the generator to produce beaucoup (a lot of) electricity. This is called "work out," the main goal of the whole system.

Next the condenser needs a way to remove heat. Some kind of cooling system with pipes of its own uses cold water or gas to extract heat from the primary loop. The heat goes to an outside heat sink, which might be a cooling tower that transfers heat to the atmosphere, or a body of cool water, like a majestic river or deep lake. This is called "heat out." Often this heat is wasted, but sometimes this leftover heat is useful, say, to warm buildings in the winter.

In case you were wondering, the water from the primary loop is not released to the outside unless there is a problem. It also does not mix with whatever is flowing through the secondary loops.

## Graphing the Rankine Cycle

Now that you have some mental pictures to give you a real-world perspective, let's look at some interesting graphs. Are you ready?

### pv Graph

The first graph below shows how the pressure (p) and volume (v) change as the water goes through the Rankine cycle. This has a very clever name, the Rankine cycle pv graph. We can understand the graph by walking through the stages.

![pv Graph](/images/courses/limits-of-nature/pv-graph-1.svg)

1. Starting at the point labeled 1 (the pump), the water is pressurized to point 2 without a change in volume.
2. As the water turns to water vapor (at the boiler), the volume increases, but during the transition the temperature stays the same, at whatever the boiling point is.
3. At point 3, steam expands as it is fed through a turbine. As it expands, the pressure drops while the volume goes up.
4. Then at point 4 (the condenser), the steam transitions to liquid water.

With any luck, this is starting to sink in. Let's go around one more time with...

### Ts Graph

The next graph shows how temperature (T) and entropy (s) change through the Rankine cycle. You might be interested to know that entropy is measured as a quantity of heat. as measured in heat.

You will never guess, so I'll tell you. This is called the Ts graph. Yup.

![Ts Graph](/images/courses/limits-of-nature/Rankine-cycle-Ts-diagram.png)

Let's go around the loop one more time. Follow the red line starting at point 1 in the lower left.

1. As the pump applies pressure, it heats the water a little.
2. The water is heated and gets hotter until it boils. As it boils, entropy goes up (water turns to gas) although the temperature stays flat (across the top).
3. Steam goes through the turbine, lowering the temperature and adding entropy from the expansion.
4. Steam is turned back into water. As it does, entropy leaves this system, mostly into the outside cooling system.

We made it. Whee.

## Related Points

One fun fact is that the amount of work depends on the difference between the highest and lowest temperature of the liquid. So we want as much water to go through the biggest temperature change as quickly as possible. That gives the turbine the biggest push, so the most work comes out. That makes the system efficient.

Of course, it's easy to waste that work, too, which is inefficient. The turbine has to be spinning and connected to a generator that's hooked up to an electrical grid with consumers of electricity.

In other words, the Rankine cycle tells us in theory how much we can get out of the system. What we manage to get out will be somewhat less.

## Boiling Water Reactors

Finally, here is a diagram of a boiling water reactor (BWR) nuclear power plant. See if you can find the points of the Rankine cycle. Look for other points we just talked about.

While it took humankind hundreds of years to figure all of this out, you were able to learn it in just a few minutes. Well done.
