# What is thermodynamics?

The physics of heat energy is called thermodynamics. The word "thermodynamics" comes from Greek, where "therme" means heat, and "dynamis" means power or energy. Understanding how "heat power" works is super helpful when thinking about nuclear power plants. For that matter, it helps to understand any thermal power plant, one that turns heat into electricity.

Just for fun, here's an imaginary picture of ancient Greece featuring a geyser. Greece is home to hot springs and active volcanos. One can imagine the ancient Greeks discussing thermodynamics as they soaked in a hot spring. The geyser makes the image a bit more dynamic and exciting.

Thermodynamics is defined by a set of four physical laws. These laws define how thermodynamics works and establish limits to the behavior of energy. Unlike laws invented by humans, laws of physics cannot be violated. They are the rules that nature imposes.

As we examine the laws, your first surprise will be the fact that the first law is called "the zeroth law." Why would physicists start the count at 0? That is because this law was created after the first, second, and third laws were already established. More to the point, this law is so fundamental, it took a while to notice that it was missing. Although it could have been added as the fourth law, its natural place in the sequence is at the beginning.

So, what is this zeroth law?
