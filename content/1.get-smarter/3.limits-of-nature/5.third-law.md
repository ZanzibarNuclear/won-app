# Third Law of Thermodynamics

Although the third law is important, it has little utility in discussions of nuclear energy. For completeness, let's talk a quick look in any case.

As the temperature of a system approaches absolute zero (0 Kelvin), the entropy of a perfect crystal approaches a constant minimum.

Now you may have a few questions. First, what is absolute zero? If you remove all heat energy from something, that temperature is absolute zero, as low as temperature can go. However, this law is saying that you can never remove all heat energy because entropy is always going to happen, even just a little.

Kelvin is the unit for measuring absolute temperatures. The degrees are just like Celsius. While water freezes at 0˚C, it can get a lot colder. In fact, 0˚C is 272˚K, or 272 above absolute zero. Carbon dioxide turns into dry ice at 194.7˚K. Nitrogen gas turns into a liquid nitrogen at 77˚K. You may have seen these cold substances used in science experiments or a fog machine.

Returning to the law, what is this about a perfect crystal? That would be a structure that is in order, the opposite of disorder. This is saying the order can never be perfect, that even at the coldest temperature there will always be entropy.

While we live and breath, there will always be things to organize and productive work to do. Entropy will make sure of that.
