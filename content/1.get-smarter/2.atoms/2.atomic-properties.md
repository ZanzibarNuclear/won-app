# Atomic Properties

Atoms have qualities and behaviors as a result of how they are put together. For this lesson, we take a moment to understand some useful properties of atomic parts.

## Mass

The mass of something is the amount of stuff that it's made of. You can think of it as a bundle of energy, held together tightly to give it substance.

It is common to think of mass and weight as the same thing. Technically, they are different. While mass is how much stuff something has, weight considers how much gravity is pulling on that stuff. For example, gravity is stronger on Earth than on the Moon, so a barbell is heavier on Earth than on the Moon, even though it has the same amount of iron, or whatever it's made of.

The thing to remember is that mass is the amount of stuff. As long as all of your measurements are done in the same place (say on Earth), it is safe to use weight to figure out the mass.

Except we are talking about things that are so small you cannot put them on a scale. For instance, a proton has a mass of 1.67262 x 10-27 kilograms.

## Wait, what?

Do not worry if your brain went a little numb. We can safely say that number is super tiny. Before we move on, let's dig in and try to understand it.

First, you may not know what a kilogram is. The British system of measurement uses ounces, pounds, stones, tons and so on for weighing things. For science, we use the metric system, as defined by the International Standards Organization (ISO). The metric system for mass is based on kilograms, or 1,000 grams.

To convert between the two systems, start with the fact that one kilogram is about 2.2 pounds, roughly the mass of a small bag of potatoes. (It's also equal to a liter of water at 4Â°C, but it's more fun to talk about potatoes.)

Now to get a sense of the scale of a proton, that is to say how small a proton is, we have to understand the number 10-27. Basically, it means "divide by ten 27 times." Hmm, not getting it. We will have to ease our way down, a few hops at a time.

Put that small bag of potatoes on a cutting board, and chop them into 1,000 equally sized pieces. That's the same as dividing by ten 3 times (because 10 times 10 times 10 is 1,000). Each piece will weigh a gram.

Now take one piece of those pieces and chop it into 1,000 pieces. Each of those piece is a milligram. That's how we measure vitamins, medicines and caffeine content. They are kind of all mixed in with the thing you consume: a pill or a beverage.

By the way, if you chopped up all of the potatoes this much, you would have a million pieces. (One-thousand thousands is a million.)

Also, at this point, things are getting messy. You would be better off using a potato masher. So, switching to our imaginations, start over with your small bag of whole potatoes, only this time, put them in a bowl and mash them up. Using the picture below as a guide, imagine filling the large cube with the potatoes. It's big enough to fit them all.

![scale comparison](/images/courses/atoms/1M-1k-1.jpg)

The little cube in the middle could scoop out 1,000 portions of mashed potatoes from the large cube on the left. The cube that you can barely see on the right could scoop out 1,000 portions from the middle cube. See how small the portions get from dividing by ten six times?

Now do that operation (dividing by 1,000) 7 more times. That is, divide the tiny portions by ten 21 more times. Got it?

Of course not. That's too small. At some point, we can no longer relate to things that are so small.

## AMUs to the rescue

So instead of pretending we get it, scientists have come up with a new unit for measuring the mass of atoms called the atomic mass unit, or AMU (a.k.a. a.m.u.). By definition, an AMU 1/12 the mass carbon. Why? Because that's what scientists chose. Plus, it's kind of practical. Think about it. Carbon is safe and easy to get a hold of. Most carbon has 12 nuclei, including an even number of protons and neutrons, plus 6 electrons. 12 nuclei divided by 12 is 1 average nucleon, with a bit of electron. Sure, why not?

Using AMUs, we can say that a proton is 1.007 AMUs, or about 1. A neutron's mass is roughly 1.008 AMUs. While that is slightly more mass than a proton, it is also about 1. Easy numbers.

![balance scale](/images/courses/atoms/balance-scale-p-v-n.svg)

Electrons are even smaller than that. An electron's mass is 1,837 times less than a proton's. Using our dividing-by-10s technique, you can imagine how small this is. Just take a proton and divide it into 900 pieces. Then cut each of those pieces in half.

![balance scale](/images/courses/atoms/balance-scale-p-v-e.svg)

Looking back at the picture with the cubes, if a proton fills the 1,000,000 cube, two electrons could squeeze into the 1,000 cube.

Are you starting to get a feel for thinking about ridiculously small things?

Not to add confusion, but we need to cover one last point regarding mass. You may see the term **_atomic weight_**, which is measured in AMUs. For physics experiments that test our theories, it helps to be more precise with measurements. Atomic weight is an attempt to be more precise. Good to know. However, when we see an atomic weight, generally we will round to the nearest whole number to get the total number of nuclei.

## Charge

Have you ever played with magnets? When you put two magnet close to each other in a certain way, they will either snap together or push apart. A magnet has two ends called poles that are named "north" and "south." The term for that is polarity. Things with opposite polarities, like the north and south ends of two magnets, attract or pull together. Things with the same polarity, like the north ends of the magnets, repel or push apart.

Magnets give us a way to experience an electromagnetic force.

The parts of an atom have a similar behavior. Instead of north and south poles, we say a particle has a positive or negative charge. In fact, protons have a positive charge, and electrons have a negative charge. Since protons and electrons have opposite charges, they attract each other.

![charge](/images/courses/atoms/mag-attraction-p-e.svg)

Two electrons have the same charge, so they repel each other. The same is true of two protons. They both have positive charge, so they repel each other.

![repulsion](/images/courses/atoms/mag-repulsion-e.svg)

![repulsion](/images/courses/atoms/mag-repulsion-p.svg)

Neutrons have no charge. In an electromagnetic sense, they are not attracted to or repelled from anything. That's why we say they are neutral.

Positive and negative charges balance each other out one-for-one. That means you can find an atom's overall charge by adding the charge from protons to the charge from electrons. For example, a hydrogen atom with 1 proton and 1 electron has an overall charge of 0 (1 + -1). A helium nucleus without any electrons has a charge of +2 (from the 2 protons).

Typically in an atom the number of protons and electrons is equal. However, electrons have a tendency to move around.

Electromagnetism is a fascinating field of physics that is essential for turning nuclear energy into electricity. Learn about it, and love it.

## Stability

Some properties of atoms are related to their stability, the likelihood that an atom will stay the same. A stable atom will not change without a major disturbance.

There are two ways an atom can be unstable. When an atom is unstable due to its electrons, we say it is chemically reactive. When an atom is unstable due to its protons and neutrons, we say it is radioactive. Let's take a moment to understand each of these ideas.

### Chemical Stability

First, we can look at the atom from the outside, where the electrons hang out. Electrons have dedicated spaces at particular distances from the nucleus. We can think of them as occupying spherical shells, one surrounding the other.

To form a useful mental picture, imagine an unbroken egg shell that is perfectly round, like a ball that's filled with air. The nucleus is at the center with a gap between the nucleus and the shell. Now imagine a larger shell surrounding the first with a bit of a gap between them. Then another, and so on. The largest atoms in nature that we know about have seven concentric shells full of electrons.

We also imagine an 8th shell, but that's only in discussion of hypothetical atoms, what could be if only we could find one. Let's leave that to theoretical physicists.

Getting back to reality, space for electrons in each shell is limited. The first shell, called "K" (yes, the capital letter k), has room for only two electrons. The next shell, L, can hold another eight electrons. After that, additional electrons go in a third shell, M, and so on and so forth.

Here's a picture that shows an atom of magnesium with 12 electrons occupying three shells.

![magnesium](/images/courses/atoms/2D-gen3/Mg.svg)

Beyond the first two shells, atoms can pack in a lot more electrons per shell. For example, in potassium the M (3rd) shell has 8 electrons and the N shell has 1, but in caesium the M shell has 18 electrons. All 55 electrons in caesium are spread across six shells. The way chemists show how many electrons are in in each shell is like this (for caesium): K2 L8 M18 N18 O8 P1 Q0 R0

The largest atom discovered so far is oganesson, which holds 188 electrons in seven shells. Massive. And still ridiculously tiny.

Fun fact. Electrons can behave like particles or waves. So remember that, although our pictures show electrons as stationary dots, in reality electrons vibrate and move all around within their shell. We would need to come up with a better drawing to convey that bit of knowledge. Maybe the shells should look fuzzier, like they are in the photo of an atom.

### Nuclear Stability

Second, turn your attention to the nucleus. If you put two or more positively charged particles together (protons), what should happen? Electromagnetic forces should push them apart. Yet they somehow stay together. So there must be an attractive force to balance out the electromagnetic force and hold them together. This is where neutrons get involved by applying a nuclear force. In particular, this is called the "strong" nuclear.

![nuclear strong force](/images/courses/atoms/strong-force.svg)

The strong nuclear force is the force that holds protons and neutrons together in the nucleus. It is the strongest force in the universe, but it only works over very short distances.

If there's a strong force, you might guess there is also a "weak" force. In fact, the weak force is internal to protons and neutrons. It is important for different reasons. The weak force is involved in a magic trick, where neutrons to turn into protons and vice versa. Wicked.

It turns out that the number of neutrons in an atom has a lot to do with its stability. Say you have a nice bundle of protons and neutrons, and then you shove in a few more neutrons. You'd probably make things a bit unstable. With "too many" (or "too few") neutrons, an atom will throw off bits of itself, along with a lot of energy. That's nuclear energy.

Starting to make sense?

Other lessons have a lot more to say about nuclear stability. Something to look forward to.
