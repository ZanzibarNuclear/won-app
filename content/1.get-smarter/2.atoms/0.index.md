# Atoms

![Atom](/images/courses/atoms/simple-atom.svg)

Atoms are the smallest bits of stuff. Everything is made of them.

When is the last time you thought about atoms? Chances are what you learned only scratched the surface of what we know. It's time for a refresher.

Learn how things work by starting with fundamentals. You are guaranteed to learn something new by taking this course. Come on in!

## Introduction

Nuclear energy is the energy of atoms. Learning about atoms—what they are, what they are made of, and how they behave—is a great way to start understanding nuclear energy.

You may have heard about atoms before. What you heard was probably a simplified explanation that doesn't quite match reality. In this course, we will review what you may already know. And then we will go further and explore some of the interesting things that atoms can do.

We are going to explore lots of ways to think about atoms. We are going to look at atoms from different perspectives so that you walk away with a solid grasp of how they work and what they can do. That will help later when we dig into other concepts, such as how atoms split or combine in nuclear reactions.

## What You Will Learn

Topics covered in this course include:

- Definitions and descriptions of an atom
- Parts of an atom and the purposes they serve
- How everything fits together
- The pictures and symbols (nomenclature) we use to represent atoms
- What gives an atom its particular nature
- Energy states: what happens when an atom gets excited
- Elemental fun facts
- Introduction to some familiar and important elements

This is course on basic concepts, useful in a number of scientific disciplines. By the end, you will have a few ideas of areas to dive into for a deeper understanding.
