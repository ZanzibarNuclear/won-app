# Elements

If an atom is the smallest bit of recognizable stuff, an element is a particular kind of stuff. Each element has its own unique qualities. For example, the smallest atom typically has one proton and one electron. That is called hydrogen, a clear gas with no smell that burns quickly. Those qualities – transparency or opacity, odor, flammability – and many others are particular to hydrogen.

By the way, you can use this legend (below) to make sense of these drawings of atoms. Or just remember "positive-purple-protons," and the rest will click into place.

Atomic number is the technical term for how many protons an element has. Naturally, the abbreviation for atomic number is Z.

Wait, why Z? Because the German word for number is zahl. Obviously. Okay, just having a little fun there. A lot of these things are not obvious. It just happened that German scientists, who were studying atoms, got tired of writing "number" and shortened it to Z.

To recap, elements are identified by their atomic number, Z. The element with Z of 2 is helium, which makes balloons float and your voice sound funny.

Notice how helium has two electrons that completely fill the first electron shell. That makes helium chemically stable, or non-reactive.

Helium is one of the noble gases. The other noble gases are neon, argon, krypton, xenon, radon, and oganesson (the largest known element). After helium, the noble gases all have 8 electrons in their outer shell, which makes them behave in similar ways.

The element with three protons (Z of 3) is lithium. Lithium has three electrons. Since the first shell can only hold two electrons, the third has to be in a shell by itself. Frankly, that makes lithium desperate to combine with other elements. In other words, lithium is reactive. In particular, it will react with elements with an outer shell that is not quite full. Hydrogen's outer shell has room for one more electron. Oxygen (as you will see) has room for two.

For an exciting chemistry experiment, drop a small piece of pure lithium into a beaker of water, and watch it burn. Better yet, do not try this yourself. Instead, you can watch one of the many videos of other people doing this experiment. It's free, you don't have to find pure lithium, and you won't endanger yourself or those around you.

Other elements that have a single electron in their outer shell have similar behavior. They are called alkali metals. Pure sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, and francium all have an extreme reaction in water.

## Periodic Table of Elements

You have seen two examples, noble gases and alkali metals, where a similar arrangement of electrons in the element's outer shell leads to similar qualities. As you move up in atomic number, the appearance and behavior of an element changes until you reach a noble gas. After that, the next element has one more electron that is the first to move into a new, bigger shell. Then the pattern of qualities repeats as the atomic number goes up.

Make sense?

By the way, something that repeats is said to be periodic. Hold that thought.

In 1869, a smart Russian scientist named Dmitri Mendeleev came up with the idea of arranging the elements into a table. That makes it easy to see all of the elements at once and to align elements with their affinity groups. The result is the periodic table of elements, shown below.

![periodic table](/images/courses/atoms/periodic-table.png)

This picture is full of information. You could spend days studying the details, learning the names and abbreviations of elements, their atomic properties, and seeing how similar kinds of elements line up vertically.

For instance, find copper (Cu - Z29), silver (Ag - Z47), and gold (Au - Z79). Why? Because that where the money is. Ka-ching.

One final point for now. In this table, Z113 through Z118 are shown as unknown elements. Remember how we said that oganesson is the largest known element? Clearly this table is out of date. Progress happens as long as we keep exploring.

If you want to carry the periodic table around with you and make sure that you always have the latest information, check out Periodic Table Pro. They have an app. You can install a free version to give it a try. The paid version is loaded with details that will amaze you. Something to occupy your mind while you're waiting in line or to satisfy a moment of curiosity. (Better than mindlessly scrolling videos, IMHO.)

## A Few More Favorites

Moving up in atomic number, let's look at a few more favorites. We skip over beryllium (Z4) and visit boron (Z5). Boron is important in nuclear engineering because it can take on extra neutrons. That gives us one way to control nuclear chain reactions. The next element, carbon, is also good at absorbing neutrons, although carbon has a nasty habit of burning when it's near oxygen and a heat source.

![carbon](/images/courses/atoms/2D-gen3/C.svg)

With any luck, the ideas are starting to gel. We are seeing the tiniest bits of recognizable stuff.

Let's jump way up in atomic number to another favorite in nuclear science and engineering, the largest element found in nature. With atomic number 92, here is uranium.

![uranium](/images/courses/atoms/2D-gen3/U.svg)

Look at that massive nucleus with 92 protons and 146 neutrons. Although it's tough to see, the drawing has 238 circles in the nucleus. You can also count the 92 electrons occupying 7 orbital shells.

One important fact is that the number of neutrons in an element is not always the same. For example, we mentioned that boron can absorb neutrons. Likewise, you can add a neutron to hydrogen, and that's fine. If you add two neutrons to hydrogen, that works, too. However, that arrangement is a bit unstable. At some point it's going to throw a fit and change into something more stable. This phenomenon, called radioactive decay, is so important that it's the subject of another lesson.

Here is another fun fact. Both the smallest and the largest elements are fuel for nuclear reactions. Hydrogen is the fuel of fusion, while uranium is an excellent fuel for fission. In the case of fusion, smashing two hydrogen atoms together makes an atom of helium and releases a bit of energy. In the case of fission, throwing extra neutrons at uranium atoms causes them to split and decay, releasing energy and more neutrons. It's all very exciting, so we will spend lots of time exploring the details.
