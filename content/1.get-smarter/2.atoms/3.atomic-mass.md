# Atomic Mass

![cover art](/images/courses/atoms/balance-scale-p-v-n.svg)

Atoms have many interesting properties. Perhaps the most essential is mass. Without mass, or an equivalent amount of energy, there is nothing.

The mass of something is the amount of stuff that it's made of. You can think of it as a bundle of energy, held together tightly to give it substance.

It is common to think of mass and weight as the same thing. Technically, they are different. While mass is how much stuff something has, weight considers how much gravity is pulling on that stuff. For example, gravity is stronger on Earth than on the Moon, so a barbell is heavier on Earth than on the Moon, even though it has the same amount of iron, or whatever it's made of.

The thing to remember is that mass is the amount of stuff. As long as all of your measurements are done in the same place (say on Earth), it is safe to use weight to figure out the mass.

Except we are talking about things that are so small you cannot put them on a scale. For instance, a proton has a mass of 1.67262 x 10-27 kilograms.

## Wait, what?

Do not worry if your brain went a little numb. We can safely say that number is super tiny. Before we move on, let's dig in and try to understand it.

First, you may not know what a kilogram is. The British system of measurement uses ounces, pounds, stones, tons and so on for weighing things. For science, we use the metric system, as defined by the International Standards Organization (ISO). The metric system for mass is based on kilograms, or 1,000 grams.

To convert between the two systems, start with the fact that one kilogram is about 2.2 pounds, roughly the mass of a small bag of potatoes. (It's also equal to a liter of water at 4Â°C, but it's more fun to talk about potatoes.)

Now to get a sense of the scale of a proton, that is to say how small a proton is, we have to understand the number 10-27. Basically, it means "divide by ten 27 times." Hmm, not getting it. We will have to ease our way down, a few hops at a time.

Put that small bag of potatoes on a cutting board, and chop them into 1,000 equally sized pieces. That's the same as dividing by ten 3 times (because 10 times 10 times 10 is 1,000). Each piece will weigh a gram.

Now take one piece of those pieces and chop it into 1,000 pieces. Each of those piece is a milligram. That's how we measure vitamins, medicines and caffeine content. They are kind of all mixed in with the thing you consume: a pill or a beverage.

By the way, if you chopped up all of the potatoes this much, you would have a million pieces. (One-thousand thousands is a million.)

Also, at this point, things are getting messy. You would be better off using a potato masher. So, switching to our imaginations, start over with your small bag of whole potatoes, only this time, put them in a bowl and mash them up. Using the picture below as a guide, imagine filling the large cube with the potatoes. It's big enough to fit them all.

The little cube in the middle could scoop out 1,000 portions of mashed potatoes from the large cube on the left. The cube that you can barely see on the right could scoop out 1,000 portions from the middle cube. See how small the portions get from dividing by ten six times?

Now do that operation (dividing by 1,000) 7 more times. That is, divide the tiny portions by ten 21 more times. Got it?

Of course not. That's too small. At some point, we can no longer relate to things that are so small.

## AMUs to the rescue

So instead of pretending we get it, scientists have come up with a new unit for measuring the mass of atoms called the atomic mass unit, or AMU (a.k.a. a.m.u.). By definition, an AMU 1/12 the mass carbon. Why? Because that's what scientists chose. Plus, it's kind of practical. Think about it. Carbon is safe and easy to get a hold of. Most carbon has 12 nuclei, including an even number of protons and neutrons, plus 6 electrons. 12 nuclei divided by 12 is 1 average nucleon, with a bit of electron. Sure, why not?

Using AMUs, we can say that a proton is 1.007 AMUs, or about 1. A neutron's mass is roughly 1.008 AMUs. While that is slightly more mass than a proton, it is also about 1. Easy numbers.

Electrons are even smaller than that. An electron's mass is 1,837 times less than a proton's. Using our dividing-by-10s technique, you can imagine how small this is. Just take a proton and divide it into 900 pieces. Then cut each of those pieces in half.

Looking back at the picture with the cubes, if a proton fills the 1,000,000 cube, two electrons could squeeze into the 1,000 cube.

Are you starting to get a feel for thinking about ridiculously small things?

Not to add confusion, but we need to cover one last point regarding mass. You may see the term **_atomic weight_**, which is measured in AMUs. For physics experiments that test our theories, it helps to be more precise with measurements. Atomic weight is an attempt to be more precise. Good to know. However, when we see an atomic weight, generally we will round to the nearest whole number to get the total number of nuclei.
