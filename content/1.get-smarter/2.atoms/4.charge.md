# Charge

Have you ever played with magnets? When you put two magnet close to each other in a certain way, they will either snap together or push apart. A magnet has two ends called poles that are named "north" and "south." The term for that is polarity. Things with opposite polarities, like the north and south ends of two magnets, attract or pull together. Things with the same polarity, like the north ends of the magnets, repel or push apart.

Magnets give us a way to experience an electromagnetic force.

The parts of an atom have a similar behavior. Instead of north and south poles, we say a particle has a positive or negative charge. In fact, protons have a positive charge, and electrons have a negative charge. Since protons and electrons have opposite charges, they attract each other.

Two electrons have the same charge, so they repel each other. The same is true of two protons. They both have positive charge, so they repel each other.

Neutrons have no charge. In an electromagnetic sense, they are not attracted to or repelled from anything. That's why we say they are neutral.

Positive and negative charges balance each other out one-for-one. That means you can find an atom's overall charge by adding the charge from protons to the charge from electrons. For example, a hydrogen atom with 1 proton and 1 electron has an overall charge of 0 (1 + -1). A helium nucleus without any electrons has a charge of +2 (from the 2 protons).

Typically in an atom the number of protons and electrons is equal. However, electrons have a tendency to move around.

Electromagnetism is a fascinating field of physics that is essential for turning nuclear energy into electricity. Learn about it, and love it.
