With the last game of the 2024 Stanley Cup playoffs mere hours away, I asked my friend Claude (3.5 Sonnet) to come up with similarities between nuclear energy and hockey.

Here is what it gave me.

## 5 ways nuclear energy could be compared to hockey:

1. **Power plays** &mdash; Both nuclear energy and hockey involve harnessing power - nuclear reactors generate electrical power, while hockey players use their physical power on the ice.

2. **Safety regulations** &mdash; Nuclear energy and hockey both have strict safety protocols to protect participants and the public from potential hazards.

3. **Specialized equipment** &mdash; Both fields require highly specialized equipment - nuclear plants use sophisticated reactors and safety systems, while hockey players use specialized sticks, skates, and protective gear.

4. **Team effort** &mdash; Operating a nuclear power plant and playing hockey both require coordinated teamwork to succeed.

5. **Cooling systems** &mdash; Nuclear reactors use cooling systems to manage heat, while ice rinks require cooling systems to maintain the playing surface.

Wow, awesome. Thanks, Claude.

## Overtime

Now let’s go to overtime, and I’ll add a couple of my own.

6. **Penalties** &mdash; When you do something wrong, you are going to get a penalty. For a power plant, that might be a fine. In hockey, the player heads to the box for a couple of minutes for some self-reflection.

7. **Shutdown** &mdash; Sometimes things get a little too hot to handle. A nuclear power plant will SCRAM to shut everything down immediately. For the worst offenses in hockey, players are sent to the locker room with a game misconduct.

So, who is ready to win the cup? (Go, Oilers!)
