# Controlled Reactions

In a Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR), control rods are typically made of materials that are strong neutron absorbers to effectively regulate the nuclear chain reaction. The most common materials used for control rods in PWRs include:

- Boron Carbide (B₄C): This is a widely used material due to its high neutron absorption capacity. Boron-10, an isotope present in boron carbide, has a large cross-section for capturing thermal neutrons, making it effective for controlling reactivity.
- Hafnium: Another material used in some PWRs, hafnium is a durable, corrosion-resistant metal with excellent neutron-absorbing properties. It’s often chosen for its longevity in the harsh reactor environment.
- Silver-Indium-Cadmium (AIC) Alloy: This is a common choice in many PWR designs, particularly in Western reactors. The alloy typically consists of about 80% silver, 15% indium, and 5% cadmium. Each component contributes to neutron absorption, with cadmium being especially effective for thermal neutrons.

These materials are selected based on their ability to absorb neutrons without undergoing significant degradation under intense radiation and high temperatures. The control rods are clad in a material like stainless steel or a zirconium alloy to protect them from the reactor's coolant and environment.
